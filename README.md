# Password Generator Assistance

## Description

To modify a starter code and create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on required password criterias. It is important to be able to generate a strong password for security purposes.

During the JavaScript coding process, I learned how to utlize the If statement and While loop, concat, and confirm to assist in prompting the user for valid input, and then taking user input to apply it to the password generator.
